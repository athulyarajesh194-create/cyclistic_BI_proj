# Cyclistic Workplace Scenario

Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

This README would explain what each files contains and its summarised contents.

## Meeting Notes.md

These meeting notes serve as a Project Requirements Document that outlines the strategy for the Cyclistic data analysis project. Instead of just being a list of facts, they act as a roadmap for the data team to ensure their work aligns with what the executive leadership actually needs.

What is covered in these notes:
Business Context: It explains why the project is happening (to grow the customer base) and who the key decision-makers are.

Project Guardrails: It sets strict boundaries for the work, including a 6-week timeline, privacy requirements, and specific accessibility standards for the final dashboard.

Technical Roadmap: It identifies the different databases that must be joined (trips, geography, and weather) and the specific SQL/ETL steps needed to prepare them.

Success Criteria: It defines exactly what visualizations must be created and how "success" will be measured at the end of the 6 weeks.

Essentially, this document translates high-level business ideas into specific technical tasks so that there is no confusion between the analysts and the VPs.
