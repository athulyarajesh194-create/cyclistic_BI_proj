# Cyclistic Workplace Scenario

Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company in New York City. It has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

This README would explain what each files contains and its summarised contents.

## Meeting Notes.md

These meeting notes serve as a Project Requirements Document that outlines the strategy for the Cyclistic data analysis project. Instead of just being a list of facts, they act as a roadmap for the data team to ensure their work aligns with what the executive leadership actually needs.

What is covered in these notes:
Business Context: It explains why the project is happening (to grow the customer base) and who the key decision-makers are.

Project Guardrails: It sets strict boundaries for the work, including a 6-week timeline, privacy requirements, and specific accessibility standards for the final dashboard.

Technical Roadmap: It identifies the different databases that must be joined (trips, geography, and weather) and the specific SQL/ETL steps needed to prepare them.

Success Criteria: It defines exactly what visualizations must be created and how "success" will be measured at the end of the 6 weeks.

Essentially, this document translates high-level business ideas into specific technical tasks so that there is no confusion between the analysts and the VPs.

## Stakeholder Requirements Document.md

It serves as the formal "blueprint" for a Business Intelligence (BI) project. It acts as a bridge between the business leadership's vision and the technical work required to build the dashboard.

Here is a breakdown of what this specific document establishes:

Strategic Alignment: It defines the Business Problem, ensuring that the final dashboard doesn't just show "cool data," but specifically addresses how to translate bike usage into customer growth and retention.

Roles and Responsibilities: It identifies the BI Professional (the person building the tool) and the Sponsors/Stakeholders (the people who will use the tool to make decisions, like Sara Romero and Jamal Harris).

User Intent: The "Stakeholder Usage Details" section explains how the tool will be used in the real world—specifically for planning new station locations and understanding the behavior differences between subscribers and non-subscribers.

Technical Scope (The "To-Do" List): The "Primary Requirements" section lists the exact visualizations and data insights that must be included, such as:

Geographic analysis (maps/tables by neighborhood or zip code).

Performance metrics (popular destinations by minutes and Year-over-Year growth).

External variables (the impact of summer trends and weather conditions).

Operational Health: By requesting insights on station congestion, the document ensures the BI tool will help manage the physical supply of bikes, not just the digital data.

In short, this document ensures that everyone is in agreement on what "success" looks like before any time is spent on development.
