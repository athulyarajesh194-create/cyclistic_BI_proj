# Cyclistic Workplace Scenario

## Project Background
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company in New York City. It has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes. Currently, there are bike stations located throughout Manhattan and neighboring boroughs. Customers are able to rent bikes for easy travel between stations at these locations.

Cyclistic’s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. The team wants to understand how their customers are using their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

Cyclistic has captured data points for every trip taken by their customers, including:
* Trip start time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
* Trip end time and location (station number, and its latitude/longitude)
* The rented bike’s identification number
* The type of customer (either a one-time customer, or a subscriber)

The dataset includes millions of rides, so the team wants a dashboard that summarizes key insights. Business plans that are driven by customer insights are more successful than plans driven by just internal staff observations. The executive summary must include key data points that are summarized and aggregated in order for the leadership team to get a clear vision of how customers are using Cyclistic.
